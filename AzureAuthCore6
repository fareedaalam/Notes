To implement Azure Authentication in a Web API built with .NET 6, you can use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for securing your API. Here's a general outline of the steps:

1. **Create an Azure AD App Registration:**
   - Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com).
   - Create a new App Registration in your Azure AD tenant.
   - Configure the Redirect URI for your API (e.g., `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc` during development).
   - Note down the "Application (client) ID" (Client ID) and the "Tenant ID" from the app registration.

2. **Configure Authentication in Your Web API:**
   - In your `Startup.cs` file, add the necessary authentication middleware to enable Azure AD authentication.

   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI;
   using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.BearerAuthenticationScheme)
           .AddAzureADBearer(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));
   }

   public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
   {
       app.UseAuthentication();
       app.UseAuthorization();
   }
   ```

3. **Configure Azure AD Settings:**
   - In your `appsettings.json` (or `appsettings.Development.json`) file, configure the Azure AD settings:

   ```json
   "AzureAd": {
     "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
     "Domain": "<Your-Tenant-Domain>",
     "ClientId": "<Your-Client-ID>",
     "TenantId": "<Your-Tenant-ID>"
   }
   ```

4. **Secure Your Web API Endpoints:**
   - Use the `[Authorize]` attribute on specific controllers or actions that need authentication.

   ```csharp
   [ApiController]
   [Route("api/[controller]")]
   [Authorize]
   public class ProtectedController : ControllerBase
   {
       // Your protected endpoints
   }
   ```

5. **Handle Tokens in Your API:**
   - You can access the user's claims (including the user's unique identifier, email, roles, etc.) from the `HttpContext.User` object.

   ```csharp
   [ApiController]
   [Route("api/[controller]")]
   [Authorize]
   public class ProtectedController : ControllerBase
   {
       [HttpGet]
       public IActionResult Get()
       {
           var user = HttpContext.User;
           // Use the user's claims as needed
           return Ok("You've reached a protected endpoint.");
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Testing and Running Your Web API:**
   - Make sure your API is running over HTTPS (required for Azure AD) when testing with a secure token.
   - Configure CORS if you need to allow requests from a specific client (e.g., an Angular app).

Remember to replace `<Your-Tenant-Domain>`, `<Your-Client-ID>`, and `<Your-Tenant-ID>` with your actual Azure AD App Registration details.

These steps provide a high-level guide to implementing Azure Authentication in your .NET 6 Web API. Make sure you handle token validation, configure CORS, and manage user roles as needed based on your specific use case.
